What began as a curious click soon became a deep dive into the world of web development.\r\n                    I was so hooked that I quickly grasped the ins and outs of HTML and CSS, and my hunger for knowledge\r\n                    urged\r\n                    me to explore JavaScript. While navigating the realm of JavaScript, I stumbled upon an advanced course\r\n                    by\r\n                    one of my favorite programmers (Samvel [Sami] Hayrapetyan) - the same person whose tutorials had\r\n                    kickstarted\r\n                    my coding journey.\r\n                    Without a second thought, I joined his course. His teaching had been invaluable in my knowledge\r\n                    learning, and this new opportunity was too good to pass up.After mastering the basics of JavaScript, I\r\n                    dived\r\n                    into its cooler features and intricate concepts. The advanced course I completed was packed with\r\n                    valuable\r\n                    theory and practical exercises, which deepened my understanding.From theory to practice, I embraced\r\n                    every\r\n                    challenge, eagerly absorbing the complexities. It was a journey\r\n                    that expanded my skills and fueled my passion for using JavaScript creatively.\r\n                    After finishing the course, I discovered Vue.js.Its elegance and functionality immediately captivated\r\n                    me, prompting me to immerse myself in tutorials, documentation, and various resources about Vue.\r\n                    The more I delved into Vue.js, the more I appreciated its simplicity and power in building dynamic and\r\n                    responsive user interfaces.\r\n                    After delving sufficiently into Vue, my curiosity led me to explore Nuxt.js.The transition from Vue to\r\n                    Nuxt felt like discovering a shortcut to efficient and scalable web development. It empowered me to\r\n                    build robust applications while maintaining the flexibility and simplicity that initially drew me to\r\n                    Vue.\r\n                </p>\r\n\r\n                <p class=\"text-md md:text-lg text-gray-300 max-x-md text-justify\">Check out \r\n                    <a href=\"https://github.com/mariakhachatryann\" class=\"underline underline-offset-4 \">my github</a> profile to see my projects\r\n                </p>\r\n            </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n    </section>\r\n</template>"],"names":["_ssrRenderAttrs","_mergeProps","_ssrRenderComponent"],"mappings":";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;AACa,QAAI,WAAQA,eAAAC,WAAA;AAAA,IAAC;;;AAKG,QAAAC,mBAA2C,oBAAA;AAAA,IAAC,OAAmB;AAAA,IAAC,KAAI;AAAA;;;;;;;;;;;"}
