What began as a curious click soon became a deep dive into the world of web development. I was so hooked that I quickly grasped the ins and outs of HTML and CSS, and my hunger for knowledge urged me to explore JavaScript. While navigating the realm of JavaScript, I stumbled upon an advanced course by one of my favorite programmers (Samvel [Sami] Hayrapetyan) - the same person whose tutorials had kickstarted my coding journey. Without a second thought, I joined his course. His teaching had been invaluable in my knowledge learning, and this new opportunity was too good to pass up.After mastering the basics of JavaScript, I dived into its cooler features and intricate concepts. The advanced course I completed was packed with valuable theory and practical exercises, which deepened my understanding.From theory to practice, I embraced every challenge, eagerly absorbing the complexities. It was a journey that expanded my skills and fueled my passion for using JavaScript creatively. After finishing the course, I discovered Vue.js.Its elegance and functionality immediately captivated me, prompting me to immerse myself in tutorials, documentation, and various resources about Vue. The more I delved into Vue.js, the more I appreciated its simplicity and power in building dynamic and responsive user interfaces. After delving sufficiently into Vue, my curiosity led me to explore Nuxt.js.The transition from Vue to Nuxt felt like discovering a shortcut to efficient and scalable web development. It empowered me to build robust applications while maintaining the flexibility and simplicity that initially drew me to Vue.
